            <h1>About Hosun</h1>
            <p>Hello. My name is <strong>Hosun</strong> and I am from <em>South Korea</em>. I came to <em>Canada</em> on May 30<sup>th</sup>, 2017 for studying English. I lived in <em>Toronto</em>, <abbr title="It is called Ontario, which is one of province in Canada"><em>ON</em></abbr>, for two years, and then I moved into the capital city of <em>Canada</em>, <em>Ottawa</em>, to go to Carleton University. Being an architectural designer was my dream job, but I could not enroll the architectural design program. I studied about history and theory of architecture instead, but it was strongly difficult just to me. </p>
            <p>That is why I decided to learn about the media design from <abbr title="Algonquin College">AC</abbr> because I usually enjoy completing tasks with technical skills such as drawing, making, etc., rather than reading books. I spent only three weeks, but every classes are very interesting so far even though I am a just beginner of using the tools, coding, photoshop, illustrator, and so on. I hope I will be able to complete the whole courses successfully, and I would like to become a designer one day.</p>
